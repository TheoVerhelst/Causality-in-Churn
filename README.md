Code for the article "Does causal reasoning help preventing churn?", co-authored by ThÃ©o Verhelst, Olivier Caelen, Jean-Christophe Dewitte, and Gianluca Bontempi.

## Content

 * Implementation of the true and estimated uplift curve. The true uplift curve can be used in simulation settings, whereas its estimated counterpart can be used in empirical settings.
 * Implementation of the causal precision curve (see article).
 * Hierarchical bayesian generative model of customer churn, which can be parametrized to simulate any distribution of customer types
 * Example of use.

## Requirements
 
 * R (>= 3.4.1)
 * `ggplot2` for the examples
