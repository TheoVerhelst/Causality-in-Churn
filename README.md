# Causality in Churn

Code for the article "Does causal reasoning help preventing churn?", co-authored by ThÃ©o Verhelst, Olivier Caelen, Jean-Christophe Dewitte, and Gianluca Bontempi.

## Content

 1. Implementation of the true and estimated uplift curve. The true uplift curve can be used in simulation settings, whereas its estimated counterpart can be used in empirical settings.
 2. Implementation of the causal precision curve (see article).
 3. Hierarchical bayesian generative model of customer churn, which can be parametrized to simulate any distribution of customer types
 4. Example of use.

## Requirements
 
 * R (>= 3.4.1)
 * `ggplot2` for the examples
